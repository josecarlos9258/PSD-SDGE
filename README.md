# PSD-SDGE

The objective of this project is essentially to develop a prototype of a platform to support the collection and aggregation of data sent by IoT devices (e.g., drones, vehicles), in potentially large numbers. This platform is instantiated in several nodes spread geographically in different zones, to allow scalability and to provide aggregated information.

this work was developed in a joint work between two curricular units: Paradigms of Distributed Systems and Large-Scale Distributed Systems, both belonging to the specialization in Distributed Systems, within the scope of the master's degreeMaster's Degree (2021/22).
